This is a chart *heavily* inspired by the beautiful plot made by CÃ©dric Sherer about The Office (he made it for #TidyTuesday week 2020/12). [You can see Cedric's plot here: highly recommended!](https://github.com/z3tt/TidyTuesday/tree/master/plots/2020_12)

### Code 

The code is available [here](https://github.com/daniloderosa/mrrobot-ratings/blob/main/MrRobot.Rmd). It's entirely made with R and ggplot2: not a single touch on Adobe Illustrator :)
